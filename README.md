# Playing with .Net MAUI by using the Spoonacular Api

## Functionalities

- Search recipes by Region
- Search for an ingredient (within Region, or not)

  You may select 10, 20 or 30 recipes from the Api

## Educational Purpose

This project was developed as a way of learning and exploring the capabilities of .Net MAUI. 
The main objective is to get to know and experiment its various components and standards. 
Additionally, the Spoonacular Api was incorporated to broaden the scope of exploration, allowing for experimentation with accessing external Apis into the application.
In the MauiRecipesApp, the Spoonacular Api was used to get recipe data from various regions of the world.

### Learning Objectives

- Gain familiarity with .Net MAUI components and their usage;
- Understand how to integrate external APIs into the MauiRecipesApp;
- Learn the MVVM architectural pattern, by using Maui.Community.Toolkit;
- Explore data visualization and presentation techniques.

## Work in Progress

This project is currently a work in progress. While it provides basic functionality for recipe search and access to the Spoonacular Api, it is expected to evolve over time.
