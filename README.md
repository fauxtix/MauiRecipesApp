The Spoonacular Api was used to obtain recipe data.

### Learning Objectives

- Gain familiarity with .Net MAUI components and their usage.
- Understand how to integrate external APIs into the pplications.
- Explore data visualization and presentation techniques.

## Work in Progress

This project is currently a work in progress. While it provides basic functionality for recipe search and access to the Spoonacular Api, it is expected to evolve over time.
